# Tribute Page

##Tribute website about Paulo Freire.

https://cbarber1984.github.io/demo-tribute-repo/ 

I began my journey as a junior developer with the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.
This page enabled me to practice responsive web design principles by creating a tribute HTML page with CSS styling.
My background as a classroom teacher led me to select Paulo Freire since I resonate with many of his core idealogies.

##Learning and Next Steps

- Through the process, I learned the connection between HTML and CSS. I also learned about CSS Grid Flexbox as well as media queries.
- I would like to develop this page further with animations and an updated color pallette.
