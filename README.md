Tribute website about Paulo Freire.

I began my journey as a junior developer with the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.
This is for the tribute page assignment in their responsive web design module.
My background as a classroom teacher led me to select Paulo Freire since I resonate with many of his core idealogies.

Through the process, I learned the connection between HTML and CSS. I also learned about CSS Grid Flexbox as well as media queries.
